1st trigger
changed execute shell to have only echo statement
2nd trigger
removed check box on use secret text
3rd trigger
fixed missing " from end of echo command!
4th trigger
that worked
adding in sud get-apt update...
5th trigger
that failed, sudo needs a password
edited sudoers to allow sudo with no password
6th trigger
that worked
adding in the rest of the commands instead of using git repository to see if I can get them to work
7th trigger
fixed rogue deploy.sh command
8th trigger
apt install python3.8-venv failed
error says may need sudo with the command - actually a typo, already had sudo
also has -Im, ensurepip, --upgrade, --default-pip
will have to look at what those mean...
9th trigger
still have a failing install of python
made a change to troubleshoot
10th trigger
there was another sudo typo...
11th trigger
added -y on install so that [y/n] abort doesn't happen
---That worked!---
12th trigger
Add in venv...
13th trigger
repeat echo so can see what's working
